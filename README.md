# J.A.R.V.I.S - Python Virtual Assistant

J.A.R.V.I.S (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a virtual assistant built using Python, designed to perform various tasks through voice commands. It utilizes several Python libraries to enable features such as speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, joke retrieval, and automation for WhatsApp and YouTube.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** J.A.R.V.I.S supports multiple speech recognition engines/APIs, including CMU Sphinx, Google Speech Recognition, Wit.ai, and more. This allows users to interact with the assistant through voice commands.

- **Audio I/O with PyAudio:** The PyAudio library provides Python bindings for PortAudio v19, enabling J.A.R.V.I.S to play and record audio on different platforms, such as GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Apple macOS.

- **Programmer Jokes with PyJokes:** J.A.R.V.I.S can lighten the mood by providing one-line jokes for programmers, thanks to the PyJokes module.

- **WhatsApp and YouTube Automation with PyWhatKit:** This feature-rich Python library facilitates automation for WhatsApp and YouTube, making it easier to perform tasks on these platforms.

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion with Pyttsx3:** J.A.R.V.I.S uses Pyttsx3 to convert text into speech. Unlike other libraries, Pyttsx3 works offline and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
